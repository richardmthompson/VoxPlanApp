# VoxPlan

**A hierarchical goal management Android app with gamified focus sessions**

VoxPlan helps you break down ambitious goals into actionable tasks, set daily time quotas, and stay focused with a gamified timer that rewards sustained concentration.

> *"Time is the one truly limited resource. We all have the same 24 hours, but some people achieve far more than others."*

## Features

### Hierarchical Goal Management
Organize your goals in a natural tree structure up to 3 levels deep:

```
Learn Guitar (Level 1)
├── Master Chord Progressions (Level 2)
│   ├── Practice G-C-D progression (Level 3)
│   └── Learn F chord fingering (Level 3)
└── Learn to Read Tablature (Level 2)
```

- **Breadcrumb navigation** for easy traversal
- **Reorder goals** vertically or move them up/down the hierarchy
- **No overwhelm** — the 3-level limit keeps things manageable

### Daily Quotas
Set time commitments for each goal:
- Define **daily minute targets** (e.g., 60 minutes for "Programming")
- Configure **active days** (e.g., Monday–Friday only)
- Quotas appear in your weekly progress view

### Gamified Focus Mode
A timer that makes focused work rewarding:

| Medal | Time Required |
|-------|---------------|
| 🥉 Bronze | 30 minutes |
| 🥈 Silver | 60 minutes |
| 🥇 Gold | 90 minutes |
| 💎 Diamond | 120+ minutes |

- **Pomodoro-style work/rest cycles**
- **Sound effects** for medal awards
- **Time banking** — earned time is saved and tracked

### Progress Tracking
- **Weekly view** showing time spent on each goal
- **Visual progress bars** against quota targets
- **Navigate previous/next weeks** to review history

## Architecture

VoxPlan follows **MVVM** with a clean separation between data, domain, and presentation layers.

### Key Patterns

**1. Manual Dependency Injection**
```kotlin
// AppContainer.kt
class AppDataContainer(context: Context) : AppContainer {
    override val database: AppDatabase by lazy { ... }
    override val todoRepository: TodoRepository by lazy { ... }
}
```
*Why?* Simpler than Hilt, no reflection overhead, all dependencies visible.

**2. StateFlow for Reactive UI**
```kotlin
val mainUiState: StateFlow<MainUiState> = combine(
    repository.getAllTodos(),
    sharedViewModel.breadcrumbs
) { todos, breadcrumbs ->
    MainUiState(goalList = processGoals(todos, currentParentId), breadcrumbs)
}.stateIn(viewModelScope, SharingStarted.WhileSubscribed(5_000L), MainUiState())
```

**3. SharedViewModel for Cross-Screen State**
The breadcrumb navigation state is shared across multiple ViewModels through a singleton SharedViewModel.

**4. Room TypeConverters**
`LocalDate` → `Long` (epoch day), `LocalTime` → `String`

For detailed architecture documentation, see [`agent/context/codebase_context.md`](agent/context/codebase_context.md).

## Contributing

VoxPlan is a great project for learning Android development with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose!

### Good First Issues

**Easy:**
- Add unit tests for `SharedViewModel.processGoals()`
- Improve accessibility (content descriptions for icons)
- Add loading/error states to screens

**Medium:**
- Implement proper Material 3 theming (see "Known Limitations" below)
- Add completion checkboxes for goals
- Fix scroll position persistence in schedule view

**Advanced:**
- Implement the Dailies feature (code exists, needs integration)
- Add calendar/scheduling features
- Implement recurring events
- **Voice-controlled interface** — the original vision! Add speech recognition for hands-free goal entry, scheduling, and focus mode control (see "Future Vision" below)

### Development Notes

**Context for AI Coding Assistants:**
The `agent/context/` directory contains detailed documentation designed for AI pair programming:
- `project_context.md` — High-level project overview
- `codebase_context.md` — Technical implementation details
- `material3_context.md` — Material 3 migration plan

**Database Migrations:**
The app has 13 database migrations. When modifying entities:
1. Create a new migration in `AppDatabase.kt`
2. Increment the version number
3. Test the migration path

---

## Known Limitations

### Material 3 Theming
The app has Material 3 infrastructure but **doesn't fully use it**:
- Theme exists in `Theme.kt` but screens use hardcoded colors
- **No dark mode support** despite user demand
- 26 color constants + 42+ inline hex values scattered across the codebase

A migration plan exists in `agent/context/material3_context.md`.

### Deferred Features
These features have partial implementations but are hidden in the MVP:

**Dailies Feature (~70% complete)**
- Daily task list with quota integration
- Scheduling tasks into time blocks
- Missing: completion tracking, bulk operations

**Scheduling Feature (~65% complete)**
- Day view with drag-to-reschedule
- Missing: event creation from calendar, recurrence, week/month views

The code is preserved and can be re-enabled. See `docs/LLM-Generated/INCOMPLETE_FEATURES.md` for details.

### Minor Issues
- Some deprecated icon usage (cosmetic)
- `QuickScheduleScreen.kt` is entirely commented out
- No unit tests yet

---

## Future Vision

The long-term vision for VoxPlan is a **conversational personal assistant** — not just a passive tool, but a proactive coach that guides you through planning and execution.

**Planned versions:**
- **v4:** Voice-controlled goal entry and scheduling
- **v5:** Cloud sync and desktop connectivity
- **v6:** AI-driven "secretary conversations" for intelligent planning
