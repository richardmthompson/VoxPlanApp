Voxplan pitch

This thing all things devours
Birds, beasts, trees, flowers,
gnaws iron, bites steel,
grinds hard stones to meal
slays king, ruins town,
and beats mountains down

We all have the same amount of it,
But some make more than others.
and some spend much of it but gain little.

What am I?
Time.

The one truly limited resource.  

Do you ever feel like you have too much to do and not enough time?
That if you could only organise your time better, and prioritise your goals, that you would get more out of life?
Do you sometimes feel you need a personal assistant to manage your busy life?
Do you set goals but never achieve them for no other reason than you didn't make time for them?

These are the problems Voxplan is designed to remedy.

It's a personal assistant in your pocket.
It helps you set goals, organise them, plan each step and make sure everything that's important to you is scheduled accordingly.
It also maintains an accurate account of how you spent your time, and helps you re-schedule things that were missed or that you didn't have time for.
It helps to focus you when you need to eliminate all distractions.
It helps you visualise your goals, and sanity-check the path to achieving them.

To achieve anything significant, we must apply consistent effort.
This requires commitment, yes, but also, and just as importantly, it requires scheduling.
Our days, weeks and months are made up of blocks of time that we spend doing things.
For the goal-oriented person who has long term goals, some of these blocks of time are spent practicing skills and doing activities that gradually move us closer to our goals.

Let's say you want to learn to play guitar.  You need to set aside time every week to do so, possibly schedule a lesson with a teacher, and follow some kind of plan.

So you need to schedule a certain number of time blocks, decide where they should be, and then within those time blocks, work on a progressive series of goals.  Having goals to achieve, for example, learning a particular song or sequence of songs, keeps you motivated.

Voxplan enables you to set your overall goal ("learn guitar"), set a sequence of sub-goals, and schedule time blocks where you work towards those goals.  it helps you select the current goal, and accrue time-credits towards it (so you can see how long you've spent working towards different goals).

Then, it helps you review how you're spending your time over the week or month, and decide whether you need to re-balance your priorities, or change your schedule to adjust your focus accordingly.

It allows you to manage as many goals as you can schedule into your week!

# whats' different about voxplan?

Where Voxplan stands out is you interact primarily through a *conversational interface*, i.e. the app proactively talks you through what needs to be done, and retrieves information and feedback from you speaking to it.

It doesn't just passively sit there waiting for input.  It proactively helps you plan your strategies, and then schedule and actually carry them out, like having an always-available personal coach or assistant.
