{"id":"VoxPlanApp-q6l","title":"FocusMode: SavedStateHandle restores stale state after process death","description":"**CRITICAL P0 BUG**: When app is backgrounded and process is killed, timer restoration shows state from BEFORE backgrounding. Timer 'goes backwards in time' - user sees old values, not current progress.\n\n**Evidence:**\n- User starts timer, runs for 2 minutes (shows 2:00)\n- User backgrounds app (home button)\n- Timer continues running in background, reaches 3 minutes\n- Process killed\n- App reopened: Timer shows 2:00 (WRONG - went backwards!)\n\n**Root Cause:**\nCurrent implementation has THREE fatal flaws:\n1. Uses System.currentTimeMillis() instead of SystemClock.elapsedRealtime() (can jump backwards when user changes system time)\n2. Tries to save currentTime (constantly changing value) instead of start timestamp (constant)\n3. SavedStateHandle writes AFTER Activity.onStop() don't persist to Bundle\n4. Auto-pauses on restoration instead of auto-continuing (user wants seamless timer)\n\n**Current Implementation Issues (Lines 103-385):**\n- Line 237: System.currentTimeMillis() ❌ (not monotonic)\n- Line 157: Saves currentTime (changes every second) ❌\n- Line 362-365: Periodic saves every 5 seconds (don't persist after onStop) ❌\n- Line 147-149: Auto-pauses on restoration ❌\n\n**Desired Behavior:**\nTimer continues seamlessly across process death. On restore:\n- Timer shows correct elapsed time (3:00 in example)\n- Medals awarded retroactively for time during process death\n- Timer keeps ticking as though nothing happened\n- User sees no interruption\n\n**Files Involved:**\n- app/src/main/java/com/voxplanapp/ui/focusmode/FocusViewModel.kt (primary changes)\n- Detailed plan: scratchpad/2025-12-22-140400_fix-savedstatehandle-stale-state/plan.md\n\n**Impact:**\nUsers lose focus session progress on process death.
